Today i.e 06-08-2023 I have solved 3 problems 

1. Max Depth of the tree 
Calculate and RETURN one value ie the depth of a binary tree

2. Chocolate problem 
An array containing size/height of chocolate bars are given and few chocolates are needed 
to be selected in such a way that the height difference between tallest and smallest chocolate
is minimum.
RETURN that minimum difference

3. Reverse an array 
No Auxilary space is to be used 
Make a function that RETURNS an Array and RETURN that new Array
