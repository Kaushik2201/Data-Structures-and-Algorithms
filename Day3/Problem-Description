I have solved 3 problems today i.e 05-08-2023

1. To check if the fiven string is a Palindrome or not 
Return true if it is or else false. 
I have used 2 techniques 
a) With the help of stack
b) By comparing start and end of that same string by the help of two pointers

2. To check if a string is an anagram 
Return true if it is else false

3. Valid Parenthesis 
If a bracket is opened it should be closed to be valid 
Return true if its valid or else false
